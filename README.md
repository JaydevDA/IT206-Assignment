# Description

-The Snake Game in C++ is a classic arcade-style game built to demonstrate fundamental programming concepts such as game loops, user input handling, and collision detection. What makes this version unique is its 
 clean, modular code structure, making it easy to modify and extend with additional features like scoring, speed variations, or graphical enhancements.
-We will be using c++ as the coding language, and here is the step to step process to make the snake.

# Code Overview

## Include Libraries:

#include <iostream> - OS Agnostic // for doing i/p and o/p operations  
#include <conio.h> - Non-OS Agnostic // for doing console i/p and o/p operations  
#include <windows.h> - Non-OS Agnostic // for system("cls")  

```
    #include <iostream>  
    #include <conio.h>
    #include <windows.h>
    using namespace std;
```
    

## Declaring Variables:
Values which will help in setting a graphical representation of the snake
- making a constant width and length of 25 units.
- **bool gameover** - to end the game when one of the many conditions is met.
- **x,y and Xfruit,Yfruit** - Position of the head of the snake and a fruit respectively.
- **int score** - Declaring score as a variable.
- **int tailX[100] and tailY[100]** - to store the two dimensional position of elements in the tail.
- **int tLength** - declaring the length of the tail as a variable.
- **enum direction** - to declare enum of directions like left,up,down and right, and also stop.

```
bool gameover;  
const int width = 25;  
const int length = 25;  
int x, y, Xfruit, Yfruit, score;  
int tailX[100], tailY[100];  
int tLength;  
enum direction { Stop = 0, Up, Down, Left, Right };  
direction dir;  
```

  

## Writing the key functions:

there are 4 key functions necessary for the snake program:

- **void game()** - To start/end the game  
- **void construct()** - To construct a graphical representation of border, snake and fruit.  
- **void input()** - To give inputs (ex. w,a,s,d) to move the snake.  
- **void logic()** - To construct the logic of the game ie. when and how to increase the length of the tail, game is over when the snake collides with the border,etc.  
   
### void game() :- 

- We will set gameover to be false ( to initiate the game )
- We will set dir to Stop intitially ( snake will be stationary unless given command ) and in the middle of the map.
- As the position of the fruit needs to be randomized, we will use rand() to give random values of the fruit, under the border of the map.
- set score and Tlength to zero, to initialize the score and the length of the tail of the snake to be zero.  

```
void game() {
    gameover = false;
    dir = Stop;
    x = width / 2;
    y = length / 2;
    Xfruit = rand() % (width - 1);
    Yfruit = rand() % (length - 2);
    score,tLength = 0;
}
```
### void construct() :-

- to clear the console screen, we use "**system("cls");**"
```
system("cls");
```
- Now we make a border made up of '#' and below the border we also write the score. the code for making the border under the length and width given for the map is as follows:-
```
for (int i = 0; i < width; i++) {
        cout << "#";
    }
    cout << endl;

    for (int i = 0; i < (length - 1); i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < width; j++) {
            if (j == 0 || j == (width - 1)){
                cout << "#";
            }
            else {
                cout << " ";
            }
        }
        cout << endl;
    }
    

    for (int i = 0; i < width; i++){
    cout << "#";
    }
    cout << "\nScore: " << score << endl;
```
- Now, we will graphically represent the position of the snake's head and the fruit.  
- Also we will graphicallly represent the elements of the growth of tail.  
- We will represent 'W' as the head, '$' as the fruit and 'X' as the tail.  
```
// Updating previous code:
for (int i = 0; i < width; i++) {
        cout << "#";
    }
    cout << endl;

    for (int i = 0; i < length - 1; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < width; j++) {
            if (j == 0 || j == width - 1)
                cout << "#";
            else if (j == x && i == y)
                cout << "W"; 
            else if (j == Xfruit && i == Yfruit)
                cout << "$"; 
            else {
                bool printTail = false;
                for (int k = 0; k < tLength; k++) {
                    if (tailX[k] == j && tailY[k] == i) {
                        cout << "X"; 
                        printTail = true;
                        break;
                    }
                }
                if (!printTail)
                    cout << " ";
            }
        }
        cout << endl;
    }

for (int i = 0; i < width; i++){
    cout << "#";
    }
    cout << "\nScore: " << score << endl;
```
- in this part of the above code:
```
else {
                bool printTail = false;
                for (int k = 0; k < tLength; k++) {
                    if (tailX[k] == j && tailY[k] == i) {
                        cout << "X"; 
                        printTail = true;
                        break;
                    }
                }
                if (!printTail)
                    cout << " ";
            }
```
- Here, we take bool printTail, to specify if the specific cell at the position (j,i) is printed or not.  
- By default, we take printTail to be false, as we have not printed a tail segment anywhere.  
- After traversing, when (j,i) is equal to the position at tailX and tailY, we print the tail as 'X', and to specify that the cell is printed, we set printTail to be true.  
- Any other position will be printed as " ".
